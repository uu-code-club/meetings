## Objects

The five basic (*atomic*) classes of R objects: 

<!--listed in order of importance
 real numbers ar edecimal numbers
 every vetors contains one data typr
 -->

1. character
2. numeric (real numbers)
3. integers
4. complex
5. logical (`TRUE`/`FALSE`)

\vfill

The most basic object is a vector  

- A vector can only contain objects of the same class   
- **The one exception is a list, which looks like a vector but can contain objects of different classes**

## Numbers

<!--ldouble precision is 64 bits long
 -->

- Numbers are treated as numeric objects (double precision real numbers)
- Creating an integer requires the suffix `L`
- `>  12L`
- Special number `Inf`, means infinity; e.g. `> 1 / Inf` gives the answer `0`
- The value `NaN` represents an undefined value ("not a number")

## Attributes


<!--besides data object can contain attributees
 -->

R objects can have attributes

+ names, dimension names
+ dimensions (e.g. matrices, arrays)
+ class
+ length
+ other used-defined attributes/metadata

Attributes of an object can be accessed using the `attributes()` function

## Entering Input

* The prompt of the R command-line starts after the symbol `>`
* What is written after `>` is called the expression
* The `<-` symbol is the assignment operator 
<!--assessing a value to an object-->
*
`>  x <- 1`    
`>  print(x)` <!--explicit-->  
`[1]  1`    
`>  x`   <!--in-explicit-->  
`[1]  1`  

<!--this is already a vector but of length one
 -->

* The `[1]` indicates that the vector `x` has an element with the value 1 as its first element   

*
`>  msg <- "hello"`  
`>  msg`  
`[1]  "hello"`  



## Printing 

* Element number of a vector with length > 1

*
`>  x <- 1:20`  
`>  x`  
`[1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15`  
`[16] 16 17 18 19 20`  

* Here I used `:` to create an integer sequence. 

## Creating vectors from objects

* The `c()` function can be used to create vectors of objects. The c stands for concatenate (def: *link (things) together in a chain or series*).  

<!-- functions can be recognised by having a name followed by brackets-->
<!-- comments are defined by the hash symbol-->
*
`>  x <- c(0.5, 0.6)    # numeric`    
`>  x <- c(TRUE, FALSE) # logical`     
`>  x <- c("a", "b")    # character`   
`>  x <- c(1L, 2L)      # integer`  
`>  x <- c(11+oi, 2+4i) # complex`  

* We can also use the `vector()` function  

* 
`>  x <- vector("numeric", length = 10)`  
`>  x`  
`[1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`

## Mixing objects

* What happens when we mix objects with different classes in one vector?  

<!--least common denominator is used for coercion-->
 
*
`>  y <- c(1.7, "a")`   
`>  y`    
`[1] "1.7" "a"`  

* Important to observe as it will not result in R throwing an error!


## Explicit coercion

* The `class()` function returns the class of an object  

*
`>  x <- 0:6`     
`>  class(x)`     
`[1] "integer"`   

* Objects of different classes can be coerced with use of the `as.*()` function family.  

*
`>  as.numeric(x)`  
`[1] 0 1 2 3 4 5 6`   
`>  as.logical(x)`  
`[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE`  
`>  as.character(x)`  
`[1] "0" "1" "2" "3" "4" "5" "6"`  


## Explicit coercion

* Nonsensical coercion results in NAs ('Not Available')  

*
`> x <- c("a", "b", "c")`  
`> as.numeric(x)`  
`[1] NA NA NA`  
`Warning message:`  
`NAs introduced by coercion` 

## Matrices

Matrices are vectors with a dimension attribute (nrow, ncol).  

<!--A matrix is a vector but with an additional attribute; dimension.
The dimension attribute is a vector of length 2
nrow and ncol also explicetely in this order-->

*
`> m <- matrix(nrow = 2, ncol = 3)`  
`> m`      
&emsp;&emsp;`[,1]`&emsp;`[,2]`&emsp;`[,3]`      
`[1,]` &ensp;`NA` &ensp;&emsp;`NA` &emsp;&emsp;`NA`    
`[2,]` &ensp;`NA` &ensp;&emsp;`NA` &emsp;&emsp;`NA`     

* The `dim()` function retrieves the dimensions of an object.  

*
`> dim(m)`  
`[1] 2 3`



## Matrices 

* Calling the function `attributes()` returns a list with attributes.  

*
`> attributes(m)`  
`$dim`  
`[1] 2 3`

## Matrices 

Matrices are constructed column-wise.  

*
`>  m <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)`  
`> m`  
&emsp;&emsp;`[,1]`&emsp;`[,2]`&emsp;`[,3]`      
`[1,]` &emsp;`1` &emsp;&emsp;`3` &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;`5`    
`[2,]` &emsp;`2` &emsp;&emsp;`4` &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;`6`    

## Lists

List are a most important type of vector in R and can contain elements of different classes.  

<!--different indexing then vectors. also a way to sperate lists from other vectors
 -->

`> x <- list(1, "a", TRUE, 1 + 4i)`  
`> x`  
`[[1]]`    
`[1] 1`   

\vfill 

`[[2]]`  
`[1] "a"`  

\vfill  

`[[3]]`  
`[1] TRUE`  

\vfill  

`[[4]]`  
`[1] 1+4i`  

## Factors

* A special type of vector and is used for categorical data.
* One can think of a factor as an integer vector where each integer has a label.
* Factors are treated special by modelling functions (e.g. `lm()`) and plotting functions (e.g. `ggplot()`).
* Factors are more suited for use instead of integers as they are self-describing.
* For example the values "Male" and "Female" is better as a categorical variable than 1 and 2.

## Factors

`x <- factor(c("yes", "yes", "no", "yes", "no"))`  
`> x`  
`[1] yes yes no  yes no`   
`Levels: no yes`

Under the hood of a factor.

`unclass(x)`  
`[1] 2 2 1 2 1`  
`attr(,"levels")`  
`[1] "no"  "yes"`  

## Factors

The order of levels can be set using the levels argument of `factor()`. This can be important again in modelling and plotting, because the first levels is used as the baseline level.  

`> x <- factor(c("yes", "yes", "no", "yes", "no"), levels =  c("yes", "no"))`  
`> x`  
`[1] yes yes no  yes no `  
`Levels: yes no`  

## Missing values

<!-- ANOTHER DATA TYPe ar emissing values  -->

Missing values are written as `NA` (anything) or `NaN` (mathematical) for undefined operations.  

+ `is.na()` can be used to test objects for `NA` elements  
+ `is.nan()` can be used to test for `NaN` elements  
+ `NA` values have a class (e.g. integer `NA`) (No information available)  
+ A `NaN` value is also `NA` but the converse is not true
+ `NULL` values specify that no information exists (`NA != NULL`)

## Missing values
+ 
`> x <- c(1, 2, NA, 10, 3)`  
`> is.na(x)`  
`[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE`  
`> is.nan(x)`  
`[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE`  
+
`> x <- c(1, 2, NaN, NA, 3)`  
`> is.na(x)`  
`[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE`  
`> is.nan(x)`  
`[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE`

## Data frames

<!-- last data type I will discuss
 -->
The data frame is a commonly used object to store tabulated data.

+ Can store any class of objects (unlike a matrix)  
+ This is because it is a special type of list, every element has the same length  
+ Each element of the list can be thought of as a column
+ Data frames have a special attribute called `row.names`

I recommend using the new reincarnation of the data frame --- the `tibble` from tidyverse 

## Tibble

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(tibble) # tidyverse
x <- tibble(foo = 1:4, bar = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE))  
x
```

 

## Reading and writing data

Loading you data into R is best done with the tidyverse `readr` package

- `read_csv()`: comma separated (CSV) files
- `read_tsv()`: tab separated files
- `read_delim()`: general delimited files
- `read_fwf()`: fixed width files
- `read_table()`: tabular files where columns are separated by white-space.
- `read_log()`: web log files

Description on website: "In many cases, these functions will just work"!

## Subsetting 

There are a number of operators that can be used to extract subsets of R objects.  

+ `[` always returns an object of the same class as the original  
+ `[[` is used to extract from a list or data frame, the class of the returned object does not have to be the same
+ `$` is used to extract elements of a list or data frame by name
+ the `dplyr` extends our toolbox of searching by name and value

## Subsetting 

`> x <- c("a", "b", "c", "c", "d", "a")`  
`> x[1]`  
`[1] "a"`  
`> x[2]`  
`[1] "b"`  
`> x[1:4]`  
`[1] "a" "b" "c" "c"`  
`> x[x > "a"]`  
`[1] "b" "c" "c" "d"`  


## Subsetting 

Matrices can be subsetted in the usual way with (i, j) type indices.

`> x <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)`  
`> x[1, 2]`  
`[1] 3`  
`> x[2, 1]`  
`[1] 2`  

## Subsetting 

Subsetting a list by element number:  

+
`> x <- list(foo = 1:4, bar = 0.6)`  
`> x[1]`  
`$foo`  
`[1] 1 2 3 4`  
`> x[[1]]`  
`[1] 1 2 3 4` 

or, by name:

+
`> x$bar`  
`[1] 0.6`  
`> x[["bar"]]`  
`[1] 0.6`  
`> x["bar"]`  
`$bar`  
`[1] 0.6`  



## Manipulation

Math functions follow a simple syntax.

+
`>  x * 3`  
`>  log2(2)`  
`>  exp(2)`  

+
`>  x <- c(2, 4, 3, 7, 8)`  
`>  mean(x)`  
`>  sd(x)`

## Subsetting and manipulation with dplyr

The dplyr package is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges:

+ `mutate()` adds new variables that are functions of existing variables
+ `select()` picks variables based on their names.
+ `filter()` picks cases (observations) based on their values.
+ `summarise()` reduces multiple values down to a single summary.
+ `arrange()` changes the ordering of the rows.

**To get started, we will now look at how to install this package!**

## Install and load packages

Extending the function set of Base R with additional packages

Installing packages from CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org) or from local files with `install.packages()`  

`install.packages("tidyverse")`

`library(tidyverse)`
