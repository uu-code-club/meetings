```{r out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Rfordata.png")
```

## R project

- All files kept at one place
- Files rooted relative to the project

Linux: `~/Documents/work/my_project`     
Windows: `C:\Documents\work\myproject`

- Experienced users: version control and building

## Data Management

- Keep raw data outside of R project

```{r out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("DM.png")
```

- Make data files `read-only`
- Keep back-ups of the data directory: [UU surf drive](https://www.uu.nl/en/news/save-and-share-files-securely-with-surfdrive) 

## Loading data

**Pointing to the file**

- Explicit file paths

`file.path(data_dir, "my.csv")`

- Setting a symlink in your project repository

`file.symlink(from = data_dir, to = 'data')`

**Loading the file**

I suggest to always use the `readr` package for .csv (tab delim) and not the base function e.g. `read.csv()`

## Reproducible R code

- Clear variable and function names
- Comments  with `#`
- R Markdown
