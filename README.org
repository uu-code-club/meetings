At our department of Earth Sciences, we have introduced monthly code club
meetings for those interested, mainly focusing on using R for data analysis and
plotting.

The notes to our meetings are available in this repository, sorted by date.

We've recently shifted the aims of our code club to be more beginner-friendly,
so please don't hesitate to show up!

* Future meetings
We will start scheduling online meetings soon!

| date           | possible topic                                   | instructor |
|----------------+--------------------------------------------------+------------|
|                |                                                  |            |


We highly recommend attending the [[https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management/training-workshops/introduction-to-r-data][Introduction to R and data]] courses, in which
the ITS staff teaches you the basics of R in one full day event. The courses so
far have filled up very rapidly!

* Installing R and RStudio
Download and install the latest version of R from [[https://cran.r-project.org/]].
Note that on MacOS you need to install some extra stuff, so follow the install
guide for MacOS (previous link) and don't forget to install [[http://xquartz.macosforge.org/][XQuartz]].

RStudio is probably the easiest and most convenient integrated desktop
environment (IDE) for R, so next, [[https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/][download and install RStudio]].

* Resources for learning
If you're a beginner, it's probably fastest to learn the basics of R by
yourself! We recommend using interactive courses or packages over books,
because the exercises make you obtain the new skills much faster!

Once you have installed R and RStudio, don't get tempted into clicking
everywhere with the mouse! R is a programming language, speak to it with the
keyboard! Go to the command prompt, bottom left thingie that starts with ~>~
(shortcut key ~ctrl~ + ~1~), and type! Now of course you don't want to type
everything over every time, so you write a script in the topleft part (~ctrl~ +
~2~) and send bits of it to the command prompt.

To get started, you can try to use this nice interactive package. Go to the
command prompt and type the following, each line followed by ~return~. Then
type in the answers to the questions it asks and go through a few of the
exercises if you want.


#+begin_src R
install.packages("swirl")
library("swirl")
swirl()
#+end_src

Here you've installed your first ~package~. Packages are the bread and butter of
R, why write code if somebody else has already done the hard work for you? We
strongly recommend using all of the R-packages in the [[https://www.tidyverse.org/][tidyverse]], such as ~readr~
and ~readxl~ for reading in data, ~dplyr~ for data manipulation and ~ggplot2~ for
plotting. Check out the PDF cheatsheets from RStudio for quick visual reminders
of what everything does.

Then take some of the nice online courses, for which you don't need R on your
computer. You can do everything in the browser! This
[[https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r][datacamp introduction course]] is a great start. This
[[https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-visualization-with-ggplot2-1][datacamp visualisation with ggplot2]] is a great place to learn about the grammar of
graphics.

If you prefer books, try out the nice free introductory book [[https://r4ds.had.co.nz/][R for data science]].
When you've progressed a bit, the book [[https://adv-r.hadley.nz/][Advanced R]] is a great resource for
learning more.
If you want to take a 1-day interactive course, the UU library provides one.
It's pretty much always full so sign up early. All of their resources are
[[https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/workshop-introduction-to-R-and-data][available online]].
